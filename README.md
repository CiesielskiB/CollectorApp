# CollectorApp
WebApp made in order to reinforce my knowledge about asp.net mvc5. Idea behind it was that it's suppoused to store users collectables
(Like books, video games, boardgames) and keep track of them. User could then borrow let's say a book to a friend, and in his panel he 
would choose who he borrowed it to, and for how long, setting a return date for the friend to return it by.

App is still very much unfinished, but thanks to it I got a better hang of mvc, bootstrap and jQuery, so it still server it's purpose as 
a good excercise.
